## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) - JS framework
- [Vuex.js](https://vuex.vuejs.org/) - State manager

### What I learned

By making this project i consolidated knowledge of basic Vue.js features (components, emits, dynamic style classes) and have a practise in app global state management with Vuex (get and post data in store, using getters and actions). Also, I have learned ResizeObserver API and have use it for tracking parent comment width to building nested comment layout.

### Useful resources

- (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ResizeObserver) - ResizeObserver API documentation.
